# Urgent

# Moderate
- [ ] Modify the project to use a torch `device` which supports cpu or gpu instead of throwing `cuda` errors when running from cpu
- [ ] Add different img sizes support (project already takes `img-size` argument, but when using it throws an error so needs further investigation)
# Low-Key
- [ ] Modify the GUI to handle exceptions without crashing the whole application
